# NourishFund 

**Overview**

NourishFund is a charity giving platform using quadratic funsing on a food delivery app. It utilizes Solidity for the smart contracts and Next.js for the front end development. The project offers a unique way for people to make a difference in the world by simply doing something they already do â€” ordering food.

**Purpose and goal**

The goal of NourishFund is to leverage the power of blockchain technology to create a more decentralized, transparent, and robust charity crowdfunding platform. By integrating charitable giving with everyday activities, such as ordering food, NourishFund makes the act of giving effortless and rewarding.

```
## How it works

    1. When user contribute to quadratic funding, they will recieve tokens as a reward. 
    2. The tokens can be converted to NFT voucher to buy food.  

## Demo

## Roadmap
